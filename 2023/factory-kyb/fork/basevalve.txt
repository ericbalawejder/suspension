Looking for more initial pickup on small chop while braking and to help alleviate some head shake.

Softening the slow speed shim stack does not resolve the harsh deflecting on small chop. We reverted to the previous
setting of 3 - 32 x 0.15 shims but used the 0.1 equivalent looking for a smoother feel. The stem height does not allow
more than 10 - 0.1 mm shims.

The ratio is as follows:
(0.15 / 0.1)^3 = 3.375 * 3 = 10.125.

Soften the initial 4 shims on the high speed stack.

Less than 0.6 mm clearance on the bleed stack feels harsh.

The standard oil height is 270cc. Increasing the oil height in 25cc increments up to 350cc affects ride height too much.
I want to maintain the current ride height for corning and front wheel grip but prevent the fork from blowing through
the stroke. The bike suffers from minor instability on fast downhills but I don't want to lose the initial turn in and
front wheel traction.
