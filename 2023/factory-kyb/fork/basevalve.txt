Oil height 270cc

The standard oil height is 270cc. Increasing the oil height in 25cc increments up to 350cc affects ride height too much.
I want to maintain the current ride height for corning and front wheel grip but prevent the fork from blowing through
the stroke. The bike suffers from minor instability on fast downhills but I don't want to lose the initial turn in and
front wheel traction.
